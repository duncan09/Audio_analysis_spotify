Sodade | Cesaria Evora (Cape Verde)', \"There was a time Madonna performed Sodade at all her tours just to pay tribute to Evora. The song is about migrant labourers from Portugal taken to Sao Tome.

Sinzia | Nameless (Kenya)', 'Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...', '14. Wombo Lombo | Angelique Kidjo (Benin)', \"This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be.

Mamou | Franco & TPOK (Democratic Republic of Congo)', \"A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Africa)', \"From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.\", '10. Muzina | Tabu Ley (Democratic Republic of Congo)', \"Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.\", '9. Mama | Brenda Fassie (S.

Africa)', \"Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.\", '3. Mario | Franco (Democratic Republic of Congo)', 'Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.', '2. Alone | Philly Bongoley Lutaaya (Uganda)', \"Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.\", '1.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one. A woman laments how her husband throws her out of marital bed on the basis of a dream he had that she was cheating.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"51\">Muchana is Swahili for the sun. It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana? (Will you cry for me all day till sunset?).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"6\">36.

Tarihinda | Cecile Kayirebwa (Rwanda)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"6\">16. Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world...

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it).

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240.

The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night.

Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco.

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Zamina mina | Zangalewa (Cameroon)</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Tsaminamina means come and waka waka is pidgin for 'walk while working.' No slacking. They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes. Mamou is a cheat but tells her husband that every other man she is found with is her friend's boyfriend. Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music.

Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage. She ends it with a warning to not be swayed by wild talks lest one died lonely.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Madilu's breakthrough album Sans Commentaire in 1993 was packed with juice and Ya Jean certainly isn't an adulterated one.

It was inspired by Kanda's 1991 deportation from Kenya. As he was leaving under heavy security, he was touched by the hundreds of fans who cried over his rude exit. \"Okolela ngai tango nyonso, na Muchana?

Keita was born into a prominent royal family who are descendants of the 13th Century king Sunjiata Keita who founded the Mandinka Empire in West Africa in 1240. But Keita was born an albino and thus ostracized. Rejected by his father, he resorted to music. In Tekere, Keita praises his own journey through music.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"46\">If you are thousands of miles away from home and sending greetings to your loved ones via the telephone, you know it's sweet to tell your papa that all is well, wish them happiness, and reassure them that you are okay among the damsels in Brussels...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"43\">Kanda's Cantique (1987), would have been it for its powerful gospel message calling on all to praise the Lord for all He has done, but Tika Kolela moves hearts with the way he urges Monique to stop crying because he sincerely loves her.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"30\">Although the song is considered by many as protest music, Joseph Shabalala the phrase 'we are homeless' is similar to the words a Zulu uses when proposing to his bride.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"21\">Sina Makosa means I've not wronged you, why the resentment to the extent of wanting to kill me [for no reason]?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"41\">As prophetic as the song is, it tells of looking on as freedom fighters are killed by oppressors but eventually the victims turn on one another, making victims out of the already bleeding victims. Happens. Ask South Africans in the post-Apartheid.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"58\">C'est ca, c'est ca, c'est ca (This is it, this is it). A woman welcomes a lover and urges him not to feel lonely anymore, to bring the bride price home to her parents so that they can solemnise the marriage.

They lament about the hardships in the army, the bad food yet money no deh . Amid all these, they say man no run (they won't give up).</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">Nasinzia is to fall asleep. Nameless goes bonkers in this 2005 hit with praises that borders on insanity. He reels off phrases to emphasise her beauty, saying he wished he was her body lotion to enjoy her skin, or her shoes to see the view up, or saliva to taste her lips...</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"52\">This 1996 song wouldn't be on this list if only for its lyrics but it is here because it must be. The song is for the spirit of a dance, one so enchanting no man should just be standing yet there is one such. Do you think anyone else can do it?</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"53\">A woman laments about her friend (Mamou) for whom she covers but Mamou goes around blaming this woman for her woes.

Yet Mamou goes around blaming the same friend for her marital woes.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"37\">Khadja pays tribute to mothers for all they have to put up with for their family, day and night. That even when they raise their voice or hand at their children, they do so to protect them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">From 1989 to all the men who sire children, leave them with their mother and move 'disappear'. Lucky Dube brings out the cruelty of rural urban migration on families as fathers go to look for jobs, leaving behind children yearning for them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"48\">Muzina. In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor. Ley exhorts everyone to pray to God, praise God and thank God for his blessings.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"28\">From the album by the same title released in 1994, Brenda Fassie pays the ultimate tribute to her mother Sarah Fassie. This is a dirge like no other.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"35\">From 1987 to-date, you can still hear Chaka Chaka spread love with this infectious pop hit. She asks us to join her in finding the love and peace we once knew, and to spread them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"32\">Cherry suggested co-writing an anti-racism song. 7 Seconds' title refers to the first moments of a child's life, as Cherry put it, \"not knowing about the problems and violence in our world.\"</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"39\">'There Is An Answer' urges South Africans to accept that there is still a chance to share their motherland's love with all. The song solemnly asks the invisible hands to help South Africans to put the past behind them.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"49\">First recorded in 1959 as Phata Phata, Mama Africa redid the song in 1969, added a few English words like \"Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.\" It became an instant hit globally. This is a song about a flirtatious dance move. 'Pata' translates as 'light touch.'</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"42\">Lucky Dube's passion about family values continues in this hit from 1989 in which he bemoans the fate of children born without parental care and guidance. They are born to suffer because they have no one to show them right and wrong.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"45\">Mario was inspired by a Portuguese gigolo acquaintance of Franco. It is about a young man who, despite his education, prefers to live off the earnings of sugar mummies. Franco urges Mario to look for one woman to marry instead of attending to older women.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"36\">Lutaaya's greatest song about HIV/Aids. Alone, from his last album in 1989 titled Alone and Frightened, preaches about the disease and calls on the people not to shun the afflicted who only need love and hope.</p>, <p class=\"story-body-text\" data-para-word-count=\"38\">We praise heroes everyday, but we forget to praise, the women of this world... The mournful voice with which Dube executes this 1995 song would leave any woman weeping. Now imagine the children yearning to meet their father...</p>]\n",

In the name. Probably Ley's last real installment and it was like he had saved the best for last. A gospel tune with a sebene that is terrific for the dance floor.
