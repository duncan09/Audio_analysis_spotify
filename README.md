This is an analysis of music data from Africa compared to award-winning music and chart-toppers from across the world. The underlying question is why African music doesnt seem to be quite as popular.
In this analysis, i used the Spotify API to analyse the following datasets using the audio features on the platform:
    Top 100 African music from the Boomplay app
    Grammy winning music from SongFacts
    Billboard Hot 100
    Classic african music as compiled by a Nation Media journalist
    
The differences can be seen in the notebook
In Part 2 of this analysis we are going to dive deeper and use the audio analysis features for comparison
